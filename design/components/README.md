# Component Documentation

This directory contains documentation and examples for individual components in the Hello World Design System.

## Component Structure

Each component follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology and atomic design principles:

### BEM Methodology
- **Block**: Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own
- **Element**: A part of a block that has no standalone meaning
- **Modifier**: A flag on a block or element used to change appearance or behavior

### Atomic Design Structure
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, icons)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations (form fields, navigation items)
- **Organisms**: Complex combinations (headers, forms, card grids)
- **Templates**: Page-level layouts
- **Pages**: Specific implementations
