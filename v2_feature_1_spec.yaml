  on:** September 02, 2025 at 12:15 AM\n**Project Name:** Hello World App\n**Status:**
  Draft - Awaiting Client Approval\n\n## Discovery Summary\n\n### User & Market Analysis\n**Question
  1:** Developers and testers who need to verify the system works.\n\n**Question 2:**
  They need a quick way to test if the AI building system is working.\n\n**Question
  3:** Manual testing or complex setup procedures.\n\n**Question 4:** Instant feedback
  that the system can build and deploy apps.\n\n\n### Core Features Requirements\n**Question
  1:** Display \"Hello World\" text on screen.\n\n**Question 2:** User visits app
  → sees \"Hello World\" message → confirms it works.\n\n**Question 3:** No additional
  features needed - keep it simple.\n\n\n### Technical Requirements\n**Question 1:**
  Web browser access only.\n\n**Question 2:** No external APIs needed.; No user authentication
  required.; No payment processing needed.\n\n\n### Product Focus\nNo responses provided
  for this section.\n\n\n### Design & Experience\n**Question 1:** Simple, clean, and
  obvious - like a classic Hello World.\n\n**Question 2:** Basic terminal output but
  prettier - clear and functional.\n\n\n## Proposed Solution Architecture\n\nBased
  on your requirements, we recommend:\n\n- **Primary Technology Stack:** React with
  Create React App for frontend, minimal JavaScript/TypeScript\n- **Database:** No
  database required - purely static content\n- **Authentication:** No authentication
  needed\n- **Platform:** Web Browser-based Single-page Application application\n-
  **Design Style:** Users Should Feel: Simple, Clean, And Obvious   Like A Classic
  Hello World. | Inspired By: Basic Terminal Output But Prettier   Clear And Functional.\n\n##
  Feature Priority Matrix\n\n### P0 Features (Must Have - MVP)\n- Display Hello World
  Text\n- Web Browser Accessibility\n- Simple User Interface\n\n### P1 Features (Should
  Have)\n- Basic Error Handling\n- Responsive Design\n\n### P2 Features (Nice to Have)\n-
  Customizable Message\n- Logging Mechanism\n\n\n## Success Metrics\n- User engagement
  and satisfaction\n- Application performance and reliability\n- Feature adoption
  and usage metrics\n\n## Timeline Estimate\n- **Discovery & Approval:** Same day\n-
  **AI Development:** ~10 minutes (quick prototype/test app)\n- **Testing & Refinement:**
  Continuous with each feature\n- **Total Project Duration:** ~10 minutes (static/minimal
  web application)\n\n## Next Steps\n1. **Client Approval** - Digital signature and
  formal acceptance required\n2. **Feature-Driven Development** - Build application
  feature by feature\n3. **Progressive Delivery** - Complete, integrated application
  delivery\n4. **Quality Assurance** - Systematic testing and refinement\n\n---\n**Generated
